Description: This file reads in a randomly generated word from a .txt file.  It then plays
the game Hangman.  It covers the word with asterisks and then asks the user for a letter.
If the guess is correct, the user is notified and the letter is shown in the word.  If they
are wrong, they are notified and they lose a life.  The user starts with the length of the 
word plus 4 lives.  When the game is over, the user is asked if they would like to play
the game again.

Input: One user-defined character collected from the standard input stream
(keyboard).

Output: If the user's guess is correct or incorrect, how many lives the user has left, what
letters of the word they have guessed correctly.
